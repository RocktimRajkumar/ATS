## How To Use

### **Installation**
 The AWS Command Line Interface(CLI) is a unified tool to manage AWS services.
 
**Windows**<br>
[Download](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi) 

**Linux**
```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/$ awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
$ unzip awscliv2.zip
$ sudo ./aws/install
```

**macOS**
```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
$ sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

**Requirements Files**<br>
"Requirement Files" are files containing a list of items to be installed using pip install.  
```
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    
### **Configuration**
Configure AWS-CLI helps you to interact with AWS services. These include your security credentials, the default output format, and the default AWS Region.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AWS requires that all incoming requests are cryptographically signed. The AWS CLI does this for you.<p>

**Quickly Configuring the AWS CLI**
```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```
When you enter this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information (access key, secret access key, AWS Region, and output format)

**How To create access keys**

### **Usage** 
This section will instruct other people on how to use our project after theyâ€™ve installed it.
1. **Designed Template**<br>
The templates are designed according to the morphological,
syntactical and vocabulary components of text sentences.<br>
The designed templates are created for helping to get the meaningful extraction of text from the unstructured documents.<br>
The template represents, resolution of the image and list of groups. Each group has its x0,y0, and x1,y1 co-ordinates, group id, name of the group and description.<br>
i.e.
![template](template/template.png)<br>
In the above image red boxes are the groups and the green dots are the co-ordinates i.e x0,y0 and x1,y1.<br>
*Syntax of Template*:-
    ```
    {
        "resolution": {
            "width": 1654,
            "height": 2339
                },
        "group": [
                {
                    "gid": "0",
                    "gname": "Group0",
                    "desc": "Group0 Description",
                    "x0": 70,
                    "y0": 60,
                    "x1": 639,
                    "y1": 404
                },
                {
                    "gid": "1",
                    "gname": "Group1",
                    "desc": "Group1 Description",
                    "x0": 1046,
                    "y0": 70,
                    "x1": 1625,
                    "y1": 375
                }
        ]
    }

    ```
Create your template and save it inside the template directory as .json file.<br>

2. **Run Program**
    ```
       $ python main.py "bucketName" "fileName" "templateName"
    ```

    > "bucketName" :- Name of the s3 bucket<br>
"fileName" :- Name of the file in s3 bucket<br>
"templateName" :- Name of the template created inside the template directory

    e.g
    ```
    $ python main.py poc-cloud-bucket invoice.pdf template.json
    ```
